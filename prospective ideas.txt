prospective ideas:

agrotech - 
	recommendation/chatbot system that will give farming advice specific to a person - based on weather + time of the year + location etc.
	recommend seeds/fertilizers + farming equipment etc. to farmers based on budget/irrigation means/soil type to the farmer - basically personalised advice
	for now, database will be localised to karnataka as collecting data would be difficult
	main problem - obtaining database + how to educate farmers
	business model - can be sold to the govt and can be used in one of the schemes/yojanas to educate farmers

healthcare(eDoctor) - 
	take biodata as input and give health recommendations + use ml models to predict by when the user will get better


-->machine translation for chatbot - gives advice



google cloud - variety of products - dont need to worry about technical details as that will be done by the services provided by cloud
main goal - look for a optimal problem statment and see where and how and service offered by google cloud can be used there
or vice versa

concept deadline - 4th
by 7th - need to be done w a plan of action - steps to be implemented - technical documentation - also set next milestone
ideally speaking,
by 31st - have a barebones product ready
till about 8th - finishing touches + debug
till 15th - ppt + marketing + business model
